    <h1>Welcome, this is simpleWeb</h1>
    <h3>This is a simple website using only vanilla HTML.</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      I'm creating this website as basic training to reinforce my learning on
      how to manipulate the HTML elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's start by referencing them alphabetically (based on their
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/">tag</a>).
    </p>
    <!-- This is a comment. -->
    <br />
    <h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
    <p>
      My favorite author is Isaac Asimov, you can find more info about him on
      his Wikipedia page
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov">here</a>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Abbreviations</h2>
    <p>
      I think the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> is an interesting
      concept, a community for nations focused on the betterment of its
      constituents.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Addresses</h2>
    <p>This would probably be an article or some piece of text.</p>
    <address>
      Written by John Doe.<br />john@doe.com<br />Placeland,Placeissippi, USA
    </address>
    <br />
    <h2>Areas</h2>
    <p>
      These ones are actually new to me, never seen (or noticed them) before!
      <br />
      This is some pretty cool stuff though, click on the colors or the
      shield/coat of arms, each will redirect you somewhere.
    </p>
    <img
      src="ahttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Flag_of_Mexico.svg"
      alt="Mexican Flag_of_Mexico"
      usemap="#mexflag"
      width="600"
      height="300"
    />
    <map name="mexflag">
      <area
        target="_blank"
        alt="Coat of arms"
        title="Coat of arms"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Mexico"
        coords="300,150,70"
        shape="circle"
      />
      <area
        target="_blank"
        alt="Green"
        title="Green"
        href="https://encycolorpedia.com/006847"
        coords="0,300,200,0"
        shape="rect"
      />
      <area
        target="_blank"
        alt="White"
        title="White"
        href="https://encycolorpedia.com/ffffff"
        coords="200,300,400,0"
        shape="rect"
      />
      <area
        target="_blank"
        alt="Red"
        title="Red"
        href="https://encycolorpedia.com/CE1126"
        coords="400,300,600,0"
        shape="rect"
      />
    </map>
    <p>
      This works by mapping areas of the image, I placed 3 rectangles and 1
      circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flag is a 600x300 image, where the first rectangle is started on the
      coords 0,300 (x,y of the top left) to the 200,0 (x,y of the bottom right).
    </p>
    <p>
      The circle has to be placed at the start of the map element, so that it
      loads above the white rectangle.<br />
      It takes the coords for the singularity where it starts 300,150 (meaning
      the middle of the image) and then the amount of pixels to expand (I put
      70).
    </p>

    <h2>Articles & Aside Content</h2>
    <article>
      <h2>Divinity: Original Sin II</h2>
      <p>
        The Divinity II as it is often abbreviated, is a pretty interesting game
        that merges a great story with fascinating gameplay. <br />
        It introduces cool features by letting interact with the different
        elements and lets you approach the story from different angles,
        depending on your decisions.
      </p>
    </article>
    <aside>
      <h4>Bonus</h4>
      <p>
        This content would be "aside" content, which for practical purposes is
        normally located elsewhere, as there is no CSS here to move stuff
        around, I'll just place it here.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <h2>Audios</h2>
    <p>
      I changed my Windows default sounds so that this duck plays instead.<br />

    </p>
    <audio controls>
      <source
        src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/audio/2022/03/10/audio_5adfa08633.mp3"
        type="audio/mpeg"
      />
      Are you using an old browser?
    </audio>
    <br />
    <h2>Bold Text</h2>
    <p>This is normal text </p>
    <p>This is text with a <b>bold part</b>.</p>
    <p><b>This is bold text</b></p>
    <br />
    <h2>Base</h2>
    <p>
      Base is an interesting yet somewhat useless element, you require a
      somewhat specific context to use it properly with vanilla HTML
    </p>
    <p>
      You'd require all relative links to go to the same place so that it is
      useful, either that or an option to turn it off dynamically via scripts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm mentioning it here since I found the element and I experimented with
      it, only relative links work, a full link with HTTP protocol will not be
      affected.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>BDI</h2>
    <p>
      BDI is basically to separate elements from the surrounding text, it stands
      for bi-directional isolation. This is for languages that go in another
      direction.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Without BDI</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Player John: 150 points</li>
      <li>Player ظبية: 500 points</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With BDI</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Player John: 150 points</li>
      <li>Player <bdi>ظبية</bdi>: 100 points</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This basically isolates whatever you put inside, so that the text
      direction does not get all messed up.
    </p>
    <p>You can also use &lt;bdo&gt; and that overrides the direction.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Blockquotes</h2>
    <p>Pretty much just quotes inside a block, they are indented by default.</p>
    <blockquote>
      Isaac Asimov was born in the Soviet Union to his great surprise. He moved
      quickly to correct the situation. When his parents emigrated to the United
      States, Isaac (three years old at the time) stowed away in their baggage.
      He has been an American citizen since the age of eight.
    </blockquote>
    <br />
    <h2>Buttons</h2>
    <p>
      Amazing and helpful buttons to interact with the web. They can have
      several properties and actions too!
    </p>
    <button type="button">Click Me</button>
    <p>
      There are other types of buttons but they are mostly related to forms,
      however a special type of property is disabled, which well disables the
      button
    </p>
    <button type="button" disabled>Disabled 😔</button>
    <br />
    <h2>Canvasses</h2>
    <p>
      They let you draw stuff via scripting, to keep it as vanilla as possible
      with HTML here, I won't use any scripts :&#41;
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Caption & Tables</h2>
    <p>This is basically the title for the table, it appears at the top.</p>
    <table>
      <caption>
        Users Scores
      </caption>
      <tr>
        <th>User</th>
        <th>Score</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>John</td>
        <td>100pts</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Jane</td>
        <td>80pts</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Tables are somewhat annoying to do here, as you have to specify the tr th
      td and so and so, I don't reccomend doing tables by hand on HTML :c
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Code</h2>
    <p>This is normal text.</p>
    <code>This is text with the code tags</code>
    <br />
    <h2>Datalists</h2>
    <p>These ones are pretty interesting, let's have a look.</p>
    <form action="submit" method="get">
      <label for="distro">Choose your favorite Linux distro:</label>
      <input list="distros" name="distro" id="distro" />
      <datalist id="distros">
        <option value="Ubuntu"></option>
        <option value="Debian"></option>
        <option value="Manjaro"></option>
        <option value="Mint"></option>
        <option value="i uSe aRcH bTw"></option>
      </datalist>
    </form>
    <p>
      The main difference between datalists and select elements is that select
      is closed to those options, whereas datalists suggest the options, but are
      open for new inputs.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Del</h2>
    <p>This is a normal text.</p>
    <del>This is a del element. Basically strikethrough.</del>
    <br />
    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>
      This one is used more often. Creates a clickable element that displays
      more info.
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary>This is the summary</summary>
      <p>This text is hidden by default, then visible upon clicking.</p>
    </details>
    <br />
    <h2>DFN</h2>
    <p>
      This is text that will be defined within the content, mostly semantic
      usage, for context.
    </p>
    <p>
      27 member states mostly in Europe make up the <dfn>EU</dfn>, a
      supranational political and economic union. With an estimated population
      of about 448 million, the union has a total area of 4,233,255 km².
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Dialogs</h2>
    <p>This is normal text.</p>
    <dialog open>This is an open dialog.</dialog>
    <dialog>This is a closed dialog.</dialog>
    <br />
    <h2>Description Lists</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Person</dt>
      <dd>A human being recognized as an individual.</dd>
      <dt>Animal</dt>
      <dd>A living being.</dd>
    </dl>
    <br />
    <h2>Emphasized Text</h2>
    <p>This is normal text.</p>
    <em>This is emphazised text.</em>
    <p>This is normal text with an <em>emphasis</em>.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Embeds</h2>
    <embed
      type="text/html"
      src="https://imgflip.com/i/84iich"
      width="400"
      height="200"
    />
    <p>This is inserting a website within your website.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Fieldsets</h2>
    <form action="#">
      <fieldset>
        <legend>This is a fieldset</legend>
        <label for="name">Your name:<input type="text" /></label><br />
        <label for="email">Email:<input type="email" /></label><br />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </fieldset>
    </form>
    <br />
    <h2>Figcaptions</h2>
    <p>Basically a subtitle for your image.</p>

      alt="Kitty with flower"
    />

    <br />
    <h2>Figures</h2>
    <p>Isolated content. It also gets indentation by default.</p>
    <figure>

    <h2>Horizontal Rules</h2>
    <p>Below is a Horizontal Rule (hr)</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Above is a Horizontal Rule (hr)</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Italics</h2>
    <p>This is normal text.</p>
    <i>This is italics text.</i>
    <p>This is normal text and this is <i>italics</i>.</p>
    <h2>Inserted Text</h2>
    <p>This is normal text.</p>
    <p>
      This is text, <del>this text has been deleted.</del>
      <ins>But now there is inserted text!</ins>
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Keyboard Inputs</h2>
    <p>
      This is basically keyboard inputs so they show up with differently
      formatted style. Check them out here:
    </p>
    <p>
      To open the network connections panel, please use <kbd>Win + R</kbd>, then
      type ncpa.cpl and afterwards press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Marked Text</h2>
    <p>This is normal text.</p>
    <mark>This is marked text.</mark>
    <p>This is normal text, with a <mark>marked or highlighted part.</mark></p>
    <br />
    <h2>Meter Elements</h2>
    <p>This one was unexpected, it looks very interested, let's see it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Installing Virus.exe...</h3>
        <p>Progress: <meter value="85" min="0" max="100">85%</meter></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>An error was encountered. Uninstalling Virus.exe...</h3>
        <p>Progress: <meter value="100" min="0" max="100">100%</meter></p>
        <p>Complete!</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So this element shows a progress bar, you can modify the value and then
      the threshold (min value and max value), it's pretty nice looking as well!
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Navigation Elements</h2>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Shop</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
    <p>Basically, navbars.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Ordered Lists</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Uno</li>
      <li>Dos</li>
      <li>Tres</li>
      <li>Cuatro</li>
      <li>Cinco</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can also reverse them!</p>
    <ol reversed>
      <li>п’ять</li>
      <li>чотири</li>
      <li>три</li>
      <li>два</li>
      <li>один</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <h2>Optgroups</h2>
    <p>
      These are for select elements, basically defines a grouped section of
      values.
    </p>
    <form action="#">
      <label for="dofus">Select your favorite Dofus: </label>
      <select name="dofus" id="dofus">
        <optgroup label="Original Dofus">
          <option value="crimson">Crimson Dofus</option>
          <option value="ebony">Ebony Dofus</option>
          <option value="emerald">Emerald Dofus</option>
          <option value="ivory">Ivory Dofus</option>
          <option value="ochre">Ochre Dofus</option>
          <option value="turquoise">Turquoise Dofus</option>
        </optgroup>
        <optgroup label="Real Dofus">
          <option value="dolmanax">Dolmanax</option>
          <option value="ice">Ice Dofus</option>
          <option value="kaliptus">Kaliptus Dofus</option>
          <option value="vulbis">Vulbis Dofus</option>
        </optgroup>
        <optgroup label="Fake Dofus">
          <option value="abyssal">Abyssal Dofus</option>
          <option value="cawwot">Cawwot Dofus</option>
          <option value="cloudy">Cloudy Dofus</option>
          <option value="dofawa">Dofawa</option>
          <option value="dokoko">Dokoko</option>
          <option value="dotrich">Dotrich</option>
          <option value="grofus">Grofus</option>
          <option value="watchers">Watchers Dofus</option>
        </optgroup>
      </select>
    </form>
    <br />
    <h2>Outputs and OnInputs</h2>
    <p>
      This one also looks exciting! We get some flashy elements that do
      interesting stuff.
    </p>
    <form action="#" oninput="x.value=parseInt(a.value)+parseInt(b.value)">
      <input type="range" id="a" value="50" min="0" max="200" />+
      <input type="number" id="b" value="25" />=
      <output name="x" for="a b"></output>
    </form>
    <p>
      Here the range input is A, where the value is 50 and the range can be set
      as well, I put min 0 and max 200
    </p>
    <p>
      The number input is B, where the value is 25, defaults are any int, even
      negatives. You can also set min and max.
    </p>
    <p>
      X holds the value for the result, which is presented right next to the
      number input. The input modifies X value on real time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is technically JavaScript, as it uses the onInput html tag, which
      executes a JS script.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Params</h2>
    <object
      data="https://cdn.pixabay.com/audio/2023/10/06/audio_14f9198f0b.mp3"
    >
      <param name="autoplay" value="true" />
    </object>
    <p>
      Now, this is supposed to autoplay, but it won't, unless your browser is
      pretty outdated, autoplay was seen as an annoyance and browsers
      implemented policies to prevent autoplaying.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Pictures</h2>
    <p>
      Basically, load something different depending on the min-width for the
      window.
    </p>
    <picture>
      <source
        media="(min-width:1280px)"
        srcset="
          https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/07/31/22/08/lion-3576045_1280.jpg
        "
      />
      <source
        media="(min-width:665px)"
        srcset="
          https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/11/09/21/41/cat-2934720_1280.jpg
        "
      />
      <img
        src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/11/21/14/47/kitten-1845789_1280.jpg"
        alt="Felines"
        style="width: auto"
      />
      <br />
      <caption>
        Credit: Pixabay.
      </caption>
    </picture>
    <p>This element shows 3 pictures:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <em>Kitty: </em>A default picture is the viewport width is not meeting
        the min threshold that I specified (665px)
      </li>
      <li><em>Cat: </em>If the viewport width is 665+px</li>
      <li><em>Lion: </em>If the viewport width is 1280+px</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <h2>Preformatted Text</h2>
    <p>This is normal text.</p>
    <pre>This is preformatted text</pre>
    <br />
    <h2>Ruby, RT, RP</h2>
    <p>
      East Asian typography and annotations, westerners like myself are pretty
      much unacquainted with these.
    </p>
    <ruby> 漢 <rp>(</rp><rt>ㄏㄢˋ</rt><rp>)</rp> </ruby>
    <p>
      Ruby indicates characters that require explanations or pronunciations. The
      rt tag indicates such information, while rp shows a character for browsers
      that do not support this type of typography.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>S text</h2>
    <p>
      While the <kbd>&lt;del&gt;</kbd> tag is used to indicate text that has
      been deleted, and looks like it has a strikethrough, the S tag basically
      does the same! But, it's to indicate the text is no longer correct. As in,
      it's not deleted, it's just no longer correct. Let's see.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><s>Looking for my Dog Tony! He's an old, long-haired chihuahua</s></p>
      <p>Nvm I've found him!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <br />
    <h2>Sample text</h2>
    <p>This is normal text.</p>

      This is very similar to kbd, pre, code, they are all used for semantic
      purposes as far as I know.

    <h2>SVG</h2>
    <p>
      I've played quite a lot with these ones, they are very interesting as they
      are vectors that can scale, meaning no loss on quality at all and
      possibility to edit certain parts of it like colors and line weight, etc.

      These are all the same SVG, I'm just using a red fill in the second and
      green stroke color on the third.

    <h2>Time</h2>
    <p>
      This is yet another semantic tag that helps machine readers or other types
      of assisting technology. For practical purposes it doesn't change much for
      regular users. But it's also helpful to get more accurate results if you
      use the datatime attribute, as it can work together with other apps or
      functions (like a calendar) to help you schedule a meeting or something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our business hours are from <time>09:00am</time> to <time>05:00pm</time>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Annual Christmas Party will be
      <time datetime="2023-12-20 18:00">tomorrow</time>, be sure to finish your
      tasks by noon!
    </p>
    <p>
      In these examples, there is a semantic time tag, in the second one, the
      tomorrow would be somewhat vague, yet the datetime attributes date and
      exact time for the event.

    <h2>The End</h2>
    <p>
      So that's pretty much it for the HTML tags, there are actually other ones
      that I didn't cover, although they were either used in previous elements
      or they are just not that relevant.
