    <h1>Welcome, this is simpleWeb</h1>
    <h3>This is a simple website using only vanilla HTML.</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      I'm creating this website as basic training to reinforce my learning on
      how to manipulate the HTML elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's start by referencing them alphabetically (based on their
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/">tag</a>).

    <h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
    <p>
      My favorite author is Isaac Asimov, you can find more info about him on
      his Wikipedia page
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov">here</a>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Abbreviations</h2>
    <p>
      I think the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> is an interesting
      concept, a community for nations focused on the betterment of its
      constituents.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Addresses</h2>
    <p>This would probably be an article or some piece of text.</p>

    <h2>Areas</h2>
    <p>
      These ones are actually new to me, never seen (or noticed them) before!
      <br />
      This is some pretty cool stuff though, click on the colors or the
      shield/coat of arms, each will redirect you somewhere.

    <img
      src="ahttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Flag_of_Mexico.svg"
      alt="Mexican Flag_of_Mexico"
      usemap="#mexflag"
      width="600"
      height="300"
    />
    <map name="mexflag">
      <area
        target="_blank"
        alt="Coat of arms"
        title="Coat of arms"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Mexico"
        coords="300,150,70"
        shape="circle"
      />
      <area
        target="_blank"
        alt="Green"
        title="Green"
        href="https://encycolorpedia.com/006847"
        coords="0,300,200,0"
        shape="rect"
      />
      <area
        target="_blank"
        alt="White"
        title="White"
        href="https://encycolorpedia.com/ffffff"
        coords="200,300,400,0"
        shape="rect"
      />
      <area
        target="_blank"
        alt="Red"
        title="Red"
        href="https://encycolorpedia.com/CE1126"
        coords="400,300,600,0"
        shape="rect"
      />
    </map>
    <p>
      This works by mapping areas of the image, I placed 3 rectangles and 1
      circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flag is a 600x300 image, where the first rectangle is started on the
      coords 0,300 (x,y of the top left) to the 200,0 (x,y of the bottom right).
    </p>
    <p>
      The circle has to be placed at the start of the map element, so that it
      loads above the white rectangle.<br />
      It takes the coords for the singularity where it starts 300,150 (meaning
      the middle of the image) and then the amount of pixels to expand (I put
      70).

      <h2>Divinity: Original Sin II</h2>
      <p>
        The Divinity II as it is often abbreviated, is a pretty interesting game
        that merges a great story with fascinating gameplay. <br />
        It introduces cool features by letting interact with the different
        elements and lets you approach the story from different angles,
        depending on your decisions.

    <aside>
      <h4>Bonus</h4>
      <p>
        This content would be "aside" content, which for practical purposes is
        normally located elsewhere, as there is no CSS here to move stuff
        around, I'll just place it here.

    <h2>Bold Text</h2>
    <p>This is <b>bold</b> text.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Base</h2>
    <p>
      Base is an interesting yet somewhat useless element, you require a
      somewhat specific context to use it properly with vanilla HTML
    </p>
    <p>
      You'd require all relative links to go to the same place so that it is
      useful, either that or an option to turn it off dynamically via scripts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm mentioning it here since I found the element and I experimented with
      it, only relative links work, a full link with HTTP protocol will not be
      affected.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>BDI</h2>
    <p>
      BDI is basically to separate elements from the surrounding text, it stands
      for bi-directional isolation. This is for languages that go in another
      direction.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Without BDI</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Player John: 150 points</li>
      <li>Player Ø¸Ø¨ÙŠØ©: 500 points</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With BDI</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Player John: 150 points</li>
      <li>Player <bdi>Ø¸Ø¨ÙŠØ©</bdi>: 100 points</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This basically isolates whatever you put inside, so that the text
      direction does not get all messed up.
    </p>
    <p>You can also use &lt;bdo&gt; and that overrides the direction.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Blockquotes</h2>
    <p>Pretty much just quotes inside a block, they are indented by default.</p>
    <blockquote>
      Isaac Asimov was born in the Soviet Union to his great surprise. He moved
      quickly to correct the situation. When his parents emigrated to the United
      States, Isaac (three years old at the time) stowed away in their baggage.
      He has been an American citizen since the age of eight.
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    <h2>Buttons</h2>
    <p>Amazing and helpful buttons to interact with the web. They can have several properties and actions too!</p>
    <button type="button">Click Me</button>
    <p>There are other types of buttons but they are mostly related to forms, however a special type of property is disabled, which well disables the button</p>
    <button type="button" disabled>Disabled ðŸ˜”</button>
    <br>
    <h2>Canvasses</h2>
    <p>They let you draw stuff via scripting, to keep it as vanilla as possible with HTML here, I won't use any scripts :&#41;</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Caption & Tables</h2>
    <p>This is basically the title for the table, it appears at the top.</p>
    <table>
        <caption>Users Scores</caption>
        <tr>
            <th>User</th>
            <th>Score</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>John</td>
            <td>100pts</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Jane</td>
            <td>80pts</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Tables are somewhat annoying to do here, as you have to specify the tr th td and so and so, I don't reccomend doing tables by hand on HTML :c</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Code</h2>
    <p>This is normal text.</p>
    <code>This is text with the code tags</code>
    <br>
    <h2>Datalists</h2>
    <p>These ones are pretty interesting, let's have a look.</p>
    <form action="submit" method="get">
        <label for="distro">Choose your favorite Linux distro:</label>
        <input list="distros" name="distro" id="distro">
        <datalist id="distros">
            <option value="Ubuntu">
            <option value="Debian">
            <option value="Manjaro">
            <option value="Mint">
            <option value="i uSe aRcH bTw">
        </datalist>
    </form>
    <p>The main difference between datalists and select elements is that select is closed to those options, whereas datalists suggest the options, but are open for new inputs.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Del</h2>
    <p>This is a normal text.</p>
    <del>This is a del element. Basically strikethrough.</del>
    <br>
    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>This one is used more often. Creates a clickable element that displays more info.</p>
    <details>
        <summary>This is the summary</summary>
        <p>This text is hidden by default, then visible upon clicking.</p>
    </details>
    <br>
    <h2>DFN</h2>
    <p>This is text that will be defined within the content, mostly semantic usage, for context.</p>
    <p>27 member states mostly in Europe make up the <dfn>EU</dfn>, a supranational political and economic union. With an estimated population of about 448 million, the union has a total area of 4,233,255 kmÂ².</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Dialogs</h2>
    <p>This is normal text.</p>
    <dialog open>This is an open dialog.</dialog>
    <dialog>This is a closed dialog.</dialog>
    <br>
    <h2>Description Lists</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Person</dt>
        <dd>A human being recognized as an individual.</dd>
        <dt>Animal</dt>
        <dd>A living being.</dd>
    </dl>
    <br>
    <h2>Emphasized Text</h2>
    <p>This is normal text.</p>
    <em>This is emphazised text.</em>
    <p>This is normal text with an <em>emphasis</em>.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Embeds</h2>
